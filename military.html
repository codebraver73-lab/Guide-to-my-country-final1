   <li><h3>Personnel & overall size:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Active personnel: ~182,500 active-duty members (plus ~80,800 civilian staff and ~34,600 reservists). Germany is one of the largest militaries in Europe and is expanding personnel levels over the coming years.</li>

    <li><h2>Heavy armour (main battle tanks & trends):</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Main battle tank: Leopard 2 family (multiple variants). Over the past decades Germany reduced its fleet from thousands to a few hundred; recent public sources put the Bundeswehr’s operational Leopard 2 fleet in the low-to-mid hundreds (roughly ~300+ before replacement orders), with shipments and donations to Ukraine having affected inventories and a program underway to replenish/modernize with newer A7/A8 variants. Germany has ordered new Leopard 2A8/A7 upgrades and is procuring additional vehicles to rebuild capacity.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Why it matters:Leopard 2 is a modern Western MBT (120 mm gun, advanced armour) and is the backbone of Germany’s heavy land component; rebuilding numbers is a major focus of recent procurement.</p>

    <br>
    <li><h3>Infantry Fighting Vehicles & wheeled armour:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Puma IFV: Germany’s advanced tracked infantry fighting vehicle (30-mm autocannon, modular armour). Deliveries have increased over recent years (several hundred machines delivered/ordered).</li>
      <li>New wheeled armoured vehicles: Germany has recently approved large purchases of hundreds of wheeled armoured vehicles (scout vehicles and “Schakal” wheeled IFVs) under multi-billion euro contracts to be delivered in the late 2020s — part of a major push to modernize mechanized forces.</li>

    <br>
    <li><h3>Artillery & fire support:</h3>  
    <ul>
      <li>PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer: one of the world’s most capable 155 mm SPHs (long range, high rate of fire). Germany has fielded over 100 in service historically; several batches were donated/forwarded to partners/Ukraine and Germany continues modernization and replacement purchases.</li>
      <li>MLRS / rocket artillery: Germany operates / fields multiple rocket systems and has been active in supplying/modernizing missile/artillery systems. (See procurement and donations in recent defence packages.)</li>

    <li><h3>Combat aircraft & air power:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eurofighter (Typhoon): The Eurofighter is the Luftwaffe’s main combat aircraft. Germany operates ~138 Eurofighters (backbone of fighter fleet) and has authorized/ordered additional Tranche-5 aircraft (20 new jets recently approved) to replace older Tornado roles and extend capability.</li>
      <li>Panavia Tornado: Older Tornado fleets (IDS / ECR variants) are being phased out and partially replaced by Eurofighter Tranche 5 and other systems.</li>
      <li>Transport/tanker: Airbus A400M (strategic/tactical airlift) and other transport assets remain key to mobility and logistics.</li>

   <br> 
   <li><h3>Navy (warships & submarines):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Frigates: Modern Baden-Württemberg (F125) frigates are among the largest and newest German surface combatants. The fleet also includes Sachsen (F124) air-defence frigates and other classes.</li>
      <li>Submarines: Type 212A (non-nuclear, air-independent propulsion) diesel-electric submarines are Germany’s modern submarine class — quiet, advanced sensors, and export success.</li>
      <li>Corvettes / mine warfare: Germany keeps a modest, modern navy oriented to NATO operations, sea lines protection and Baltic/North Sea tasks.</li>

    <br>
    <li><h3>Drones :</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Major push into drones: Germany and European partners are investing heavily in drones. Germany announced plans to invest ≈€10 billion in drones over coming years and is a lead partner in the multinational Eurodrone (European medium-altitude, long-endurance MALE UAV) and other programs. This is a key modernization area (surveillance, strike, loitering munitions).</li>

    <br>
    <li><h3>Small arms & infantry weapons:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Service rifle transition: The Bundeswehr moved to modernize its individual weapon. The G36 was phased out and the armed forces have been transitioning to new rifles (variants of the HK416 designated G95 series have been fielded/trialed and procurement of G95A1/G95KA1 has progressed). There was also a controversial procurement episode with the Haenel MK556 earlier, but the current fielding centers on Heckler & Koch solutions.</li>

    <br>
    <li><h3>Air defence & missile systems:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Germany is investing in layered air & missile defence: existing Patriot systems, procurement of IRIS-T SLM, participation in European air defence initiatives, and commitments to strengthen integrated NATO/EU air defence coverage. Recent procurement packages include missiles and radars for national and allied defence.</li>
